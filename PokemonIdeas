~all other kanto pokemon can be copied from grand dad 3 if needed so its not SUPER important to come up with new ones, although 80% of those are just copies from japanese green with dumb names so it'd still be nice
some of the johto pokemon can be copied from the spaceworld beta too since they're pretty crusty
