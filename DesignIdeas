since we're just going for a stanky meme hack to start off with i got the idea to incorporate it into my previous "Grand Dad" hack series
basically the storyline would be something like
>grand dad gets lazy and sleeps for like 4 years
>in that time a league of bootlegs comes up to rank the bootlegs or something
>since grand dad wasnt there for it hes at the bottom of the list and has to beat up the other bootlegs to prove he's the best
>powerful bootlegs enslave lesser ones to work for them (this explains how the pokemon exist, they'd all just be shitty knockoffs)
>instead of badges you just rip off the gym leaders heads and carry them with you, 8 heads are necessary to enter the inner sanctum of bootlegs
>(this is a running gag with the series, grand dad rips peoples heads off and replaces it with shitty robot versions of his head for some reason)
>(i actually dont remember why i did that but its a thing so)
>anyway once there there'll be four big boi bootlegs and the champion as usual
>rival could be great dad (grand dad's brother) but i did that for the last entry in the series (idk if anyone ever actually played it tho) so new ideas are always good 
tbh we could just block kanto off and forget it exists also to have less work to do
idea bois feel free to add to this btw
